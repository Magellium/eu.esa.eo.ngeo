Features
======================================================================
All paths provided are relative to the context path of the deployed WAR e.g. download-manager-mock-product-facility/metalink

*   Idle Product (/idle)
    - Provides a product which is initially idle.
      An HTTP 202 (Accepted) is returned before the "Idle product available" feature is initiated.
      A metalink containing one file is returned after the "Idle product available" feature is initiated.
*   Idle product available (/feature/idleProductAvailable)
    - Enables the availability of the product to be downloaded.

*   Product containing multiple files - Metalink (/metalink)
    - Provides a metalink file which the Download Manager can use to download multiple files for this product.
