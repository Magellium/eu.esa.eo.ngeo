Download Manager Test Unit (DMTU) Mock Web Server Release Note 0.4.0
-----------------------------------

The Download Manager Test Unit application mandates registration with an ngEO Web Server before use.
This mock Web Server provides basic ngEO Web Server functionality, and can allow the DMTU to be used independently
of the ngEO system for testing and demo purposes.
For further details of how the ngEO Web Server interface works, see document IICD-D-WS.

Acronyms
-----------------------------------
ngEO	-	EO User Services Next Generation
DMTU	-	Download Manager Test Unit
DAR		-	Data Access Request
SSO		-	Single Signon

Features
-----------------------------------
All paths provided are relative to the context path of the deployed WAR e.g. download-manager-mock-web-server-0.4.0/register

* 	Registration (/register)
	- Provides a mock registration of the DMTU
*	Monitor for Data Access Requests (/monitoringservice)
	- Provides a DAR for the DMTU to monitor for products. By default this does not supply a DAR.
*	Supply Data Access Request (/feature/supplyDAR)
	- Enables the supply of a DAR to the DMTU. This is used in conjunction with the
	  "Monitor for Data Access Requests" service.
*	Monitor for Products (/monitoringservice/{monitoringUrlUuid})
	- Provides a list of products relevant to the supplied monitoring URL UUID. By default this does not supply any products.
	  {monitoringUrlUuid} is provided by the "Monitor for Data Access Request" response.
*	Supply Products (/feature/supplyProducts)
	- Enables the supply of products for a data access request to the DMTU. This is used in conjunction with the
	  "Monitor for Products" service.
	  
The supply features allow for better control of supply for DARs / products in demonstration situations, and are one-off commands.
In order to reset these features i.e. to not provide the DAR / products, the web server application must be restarted.

How to use
-----------------------------------
	Note that the hostnames and port numbers described below will vary depending on the set-up of the application server.
	All stubs referred to can be found in the WEB-INF/classes/stubs folder once the application is deployed.

* 	Deploy the download-manager-mock-web-server-0.4.0.war to an application server (e.g. tomcat).
* 	To ensure that the mock web server is successfully deployed, access the following URL from your web browser:
	http://localhost/download-manager-mock-web-server-0.4.0
	A "Welcome!" message should be shown in the browser.
*   In order for a DMTU to use this mock web server, the NGEO_WEB_SERVER_URL setting in
	conf/nonUserModifiableSettingsPersistentStore.properties needs to be changed to the following:
	http://localhost/download-manager-mock-web-server-0.4.0/register
*	Restart the Download Manager Test Unit (to pick up the settings change), and fill in the details on the first startup
	configuration page.
	The SSO username / password are not used by the mock web server, consequently any credentials can be supplied
	(subject to validation criteria).
*	Mock registration will be performed, and a URL will be supplied to monitor for Data Access Requests. This is 
	automatically used by the DMTU. The URL supplied can be modified in DMRegistrationMgmnt-Resp.xml to match the
	deploy location of the mock web server.
*	The DMTU will periodically check for DARs and Products within a DAR, the RefreshPeriod can be changed in the following 
	stub responses to change the frequency: MonitoringURL-Resp.xml and MonitoringURL-Resp-NoDARs.xml
*	A set of products are supplied in the DataAccessRequestMonitoring-Resp.xml stub which can be used to test the automatic
	retrieval of products by the DMTU. This set of products can be modified to provide a set of products specific to the
	testing / demonstration requirements.
