                 - Improvements to display the DAR and Product details by only updating the data which has changed.
                   This resolves the issue where the error icon and pause/resume/cancel buttons became unresponsive.
                 - Updated headings of the columns in the DAR and Product tables to reflect the data displayed.
                 - The "Data Access Request" column (formerly "Monitoring URL") displays the name of the DAR
                   if specified, otherwise the monitoring URL is displayed.
                 - Monitoring Status for manually added DARs or the Manual Data Access Request is now displayed as
                   "Not applicable".

0.3.2
    Release date 17th May 2013
	First release (limited distribution)

Requirements not currently implemented (requirement ref: DMTU-URD)
========================================================

DMTU-REQ-16  -  Web interface protection
DMTU-REQ-29  -  Priority for manual downloads
DMTU-REQ-30  -  Browser helper application

Limitations
========================================================

DMTU-REQ-2   -	Testing for Windows XP/Vista/8 required. However the DMTU has been built to be flexible in
                deployment across multiple platforms.
DMTU-REQ-4   -	Javadoc and validation report not available at this time.
DMTU-REQ-8   -	Time remaining for a product download is not specified to the Web Server at this time.
DMTU-REQ-9   -	Handling of HTTP 303s not implemented at this time.
DMTU-REQ-9   -	Parallel downloading (multiple sources for one file in a metalink) not supported. If multiple sources are 
                provided for a particular file, only the first is used.
             -  Handling of Metalinks within Metalinks is not supported.
DMTU-REQ-9   -	Only one file is downloaded at a time for a product.
DMTU-REQ-17  -	Changes to the number of concurrent download threads will only be honoured on application restart.
DMTU-REQ-17  -	Port number for the web interface can be configured but is not honoured.
DMTU-REQ-26  -	This setting refers to the product download threads. A product download will only download one file at 
                time (in a metalink scenario).
DMTU-REQ-23  -  Callback mechanism supports very basic commands at present
DMTU-REQ-28  -	The DMTU have been started by something other than the CLI before any CLI commands can be serviced by the DMTU.
             -  DMTU only allows for integration with one ngEO Web Server
DMTU-152     -  User cannot specify any hosts where the proxy should not be used

Assumptions
========================================================

*  The restriction on the number of parallel download threads refer to the product download threads, rather than individual files. 
   This is because the interfaces between the DMTU and the plugins do not allow the management of downloads at the file level.
*  If one file within a product metalink causes an error, the product download will be in error and no other files will be downloaded.
*  Every URL supplied for a file within a metalink is assumed to be available when the metalink is retrieved i.e. an HTTP 200 response code will be supplied if queried for the file size.
   Any non HTTP 200 response code will immediately set the product download in error.
*  At any one time, only one user will be performing First Startup Configuration; likewise for the Advanced Configuration.
*  If the download manager is shut down, and a product is in the process of being downloaded, the progress can be persisted but the 
   resumption of the file download depends entirely on the plugin checking the location it expects the file to be and resuming if possible.
*  If a download is cancelled, all progress is lost - the plugin will tidy up after a cancel command has been sent to it.
*  Download Options for a product URL are assumed to be provided by the Web Server within the URL itself.
*  For any product for which the download directory has been specified by the Web Server, the download directory name will not be prefixed with a ".", because it is likely that products within a DAR will share the same download directory.
   This is implied by DMTU-REQ-24.

Known Issues
========================================================

DMTU-4   - Pause and resume buttons sometimes do not respond in the Web UI.
DMTU-70  - Limitation: notification of product download from WEBS not handled correctly
DMTU-80  - DAGICD: No requirement for handling HTTP 301/302 status codes
DMTU-8   - Double clicking the FirstStartupConfig page's "Save and Register" button causes an error
DMTU-62  - Name of downloaded file may be poor in absence of Content-Disposition HTTP response header
DMTU-149 - Web UI - Update of DAR / product status not working as expected in Internet Explorer
