Instructions for installing and running Download Manager
========================================================

Installing:

  * Extract the contents of the distribution tar.gz to a suitable folder.
  The preferred method for extraction is the tar command, as it persists file permissions needed for .sh and java commands.
  * Copy the JAR files of any 3rd party downloader plug-ins to ngEO-download-manager\plugins.
    (Note that the generic (HTTP) plug-in is automatically placed in the plugins folder.)
    

Running the Download Manager:

  * Either, within the file explorer, double-click ngEO-download-manager\start-dm.sh
  * Or, within a command prompt, change directory to ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:    
    start-dm.sh          <return>
  * Once the application has started (indicated by a message of "Started @0.0.0.0:0:8082", the Download Manager Web UI can
    be accessed by the following URL: http://localhost:8082/download-manager/
       
 
Running the Command Line App: 

  * Either, within the file explorer, double-click ngEO-download-manager\start-dm-cli.sh
    Or, within a command prompt, change directory to ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:
    start-dm-cli.sh      <return>
