Instructions for installing and running Download Manager
========================================================

Installing:

  * Extract the contents of the distribution tar.gz to a suitable folder.
  The preferred method for extraction is the tar command, as it persists file permissions needed for .sh and java commands.
  * Copy the JAR files of any 3rd party downloader plug-ins to ngEO-download-manager\plugins.
    (Note that the generic (HTTP) plug-in is automatically placed in the plugins folder.)
    

Running the Download Manager:

  * Either, within the file explorer, double-click ngEO-download-manager\start-dm.sh
  * Or, within a command prompt, change directory to ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:    
    start-dm.sh          <return>
  * By default, the download manager Web UI binds to port 8082. In order to change this, the follwoing environment variable
    can be set
    export DM_PORT=8085  <return>
  * Once the application has started (indicated by a message of "Started @0.0.0.0:0:<port>", the Download Manager Web UI can
    be accessed by the following URL: http://localhost:<port>/download-manager/
       
 
Running the Command Line App: 

  * Either, within the file explorer, double-click ngEO-download-manager\start-dm-cli.sh
    Or, within a command prompt, change directory to ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:
    start-dm-cli.sh      <return>
  * If the port number on which the download manager Web UI binds to has changed, the web application URL must be supplied
    as an environment variable before starting the CLI. For instance, if the port number is changed to 8085, the following command
    would need to be executed:
    export DM_WEBAPP_URL=http://localhost:8085/download-manager/       <return>
