Instructions for installing and running Download Manager
========================================================

Installing:

  * Extract the contents of the distribution ZIP to a suitable folder.
  * Copy the JAR files of any 3rd party downloader plug-ins to ngEO-download-manager\plugins.
    (Note that the generic (HTTP) plug-in is automatically placed in the plugins folder.)
    

Running the Download Manager:

  * Either, within the file explorer, double-click ngEO-download-manager\start-dm.bat
  * Or, within a command prompt, change directory to ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:    
    start-dm             <return>
  * By default, the download manager Web UI binds to port 8082. In order to change this, the port number 
    can be provided from a command prompt:
    start-dm 8085        <return>
  * Once the application has started (indicated by a message of "Started @0.0.0.0:0:<port>", the Download Manager Web UI can
    be accessed by the following URL: http://localhost:<port>/download-manager/
       
 
Running the Command Line App: 

  * Either, within the file explorer, double-click ngEO-download-manager\start-dm-cli.bat
    Or, within a command prompt, change directory to ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:
    start-dm-cli         <return>
  * If the port number on which the download manager Web UI binds to has changed, the web application URL must be supplied
    when starting the CLI. For instance, if the port number is changed to 8085, the CLI would be started by runnning the 
    following command:
    start-dm-cli http://localhost:8085/download-manager/       <return>
