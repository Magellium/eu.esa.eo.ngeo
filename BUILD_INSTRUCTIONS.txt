Instructions for building ngEO Download Manager
=================================================

Building:

  * Install Maven 3  - refer to http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi      (Tested using Maven 3.0.4)
    Include the Maven bin directory within your PATH environment variable.
  * Change directory to the root of the source tree
    i.e. to the folder that contains the download-manager-parent's POM file.
  * run the command: mvn clean package <return>
  * Once the build has succeeded, the distributions will be located in the download-manager-distribution/target folder

The following one-off command is required to install dependency JARs which are not included in a maven repository (e.g. UM-SSO JCL JAR):

mvn initialize

If a dependency JAR is changed (e.g. version updated), the above command needs to be executed in order for the build process to access that dependency.

Environment specific builds:

In order to configure the build for a specific environment, include the profiles and/or environment with the following syntax:

mvn clean install -P <profiles>

The following profiles are available:

Projects

  ngeo
  DREAM

Environments

  ngeo-task6-tpz
  ngeo-task6-esa

If none of the above profiles are specified, the ngeo profile is used.

Multiple profiles can be included as a comma-seperated list e.g. -P ngeo,ngeo-task6-tpz
