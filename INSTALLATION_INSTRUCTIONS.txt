Instructions for building, installing and running (Microsoft Windows; tested using MS Windows 7)
=================================================

Building:

  * Install Maven 3  - refer to http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi      (Tested using Maven 3.0.4)
    Include the Maven bin directory within your PATH environment variable.
  * Install Ant      - refer to http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi     (Tested using Ant 1.9.0)
    Include the Ant bin directory within your PATH environment variable.
  * Change directory to the root of the source tree (referred to hereafter as <SOURCE_ROOT>), 
    i.e. to the folder that contains the download-manager-parent's POM file.
  * mvn clean initialize package <return>
  * ant                          <return>
  

Installing:

  * Extract the contents of the distribution ZIP (taken from <SOURCE_ROOT>\target\downloadmanager.zip)
    to a suitable folder (e.g. C:\Program Files), which we will refer to within these instructions as <INSTALLATION_PARENT>.
  * Copy the JAR files of any 3rd party downloader plug-ins to <INSTALLATION_PARENT>\ngEO-download-manager\plugins.
    (Note that the generic (HTTP) plug-in is automatically placed in the plugins folder.)
    

Running the Download Manager:
 
  * Either, within Windows Explorer, double-click <INSTALLATION_PARENT>\ngEO-download-manager\start-dm.bat
  * Or, within a command prompt, change directory to <INSTALLATION_PARENT>\ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:    
    start-dm          <return>
  * Once the application has started (indicated by a message of "Started @0.0.0.0:0:<PORT>", the Download Manager Web UI can
    be accessed by the following URL: http://localhost:<PORT>/download-manager/
    The default port number used by the DMTU is 8082.
       
 
Running the Command Line App: 

  * Either, within Windows Explorer, double-click <INSTALLATION_PARENT>\ngEO-download-manager\start-dm-cli.bat
    Or, within a command prompt, change directory to <INSTALLATION_PARENT>\ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:
    start-dm-cli      <return>
