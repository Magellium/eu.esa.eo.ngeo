Instructions for building, installing and running
=================================================

Building:

  * Install Maven 3  - refer to http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi      (Tested using Maven 3.0.4)
    Include the Maven bin directory within your PATH environment variable.
  * Install Ant      - refer to http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi     (Tested using Ant 1.9.0)
    Include the Ant bin directory within your PATH environment variable.
  * Change directory to the root of the source tree (referred to hereafter as <SOURCE_ROOT>), 
    i.e. to the folder that contains the download-manager-parent's POM file.
  * mvn clean initialize package <return>
  * ant                          <return>
  

Installing:

  * Extract the contents of the distribution tar.gz (taken from <SOURCE_ROOT>\target\download-manager_${version}_${target}.tar.gz) to a suitable folder.
  The preferred method for extraction is the tar command, as it persists file permissions needed for .sh and java commands.
  * Copy the JAR files of any 3rd party downloader plug-ins to ngEO-download-manager\plugins.
    (Note that the generic (HTTP) plug-in is automatically placed in the plugins folder.)
    

Running the Download Manager:

  * Either, within the file explorer for the installation OS, double-click ngEO-download-manager\start-dm.sh
  * Or, within a command prompt, change directory to ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:    
    start-dm.sh          <return>
  * Once the application has started (indicated by a message of "Started @0.0.0.0:0:80", the Download Manager Web UI can
    be accessed by the following URL: http://localhost/download-manager/
       
 
Running the Command Line App: 

  * Either, within the file explorer for the installation OS, double-click ngEO-download-manager\start-dm-cli.sh
    Or, within a command prompt, change directory to ngEO-download-manager then enter the following:
    start-dm-cli.sh      <return>
